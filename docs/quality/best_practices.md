### BP-001 — Verify derived values before adopting into specs

**Adopted from**: LL-020  
**Date adopted**: 2026-05-16  
**Rule**: Any R&D report value that is *computed* from measurements (format conversions, scale factors, timing calculations) must include the derivation formula or a one-line verification command; the Architect runs that command before adopting the value into a design doc.  
**Rationale**: Measured and computed values can coexist in the same table and look equally authoritative. Computed values can silently be wrong — 16/16 RGB565 colour values in M-VIS were incorrect due to a misapplied conversion formula, caught only on DUT visual inspection. A 30-second Python check at spec time would have prevented the bug.  
**Applies to**: R&D Engineer (label columns as measured vs derived; include formula), Architect (do not adopt a derived value without running the verification)
